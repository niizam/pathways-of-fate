### 4.3 Character Skills

Each character has:

#### Skill Types

- **Cooldowns:** Some skills have turn-based cooldowns (1-5 turns)

#### Example Character: "Klein Moretti" (Fool Pathway, Seq 6)

**Archetype:** Support/Utility

## 6. Combat System

### 6.1 Turn-Based Mechanics

**Turn Order:**
- Based on SPD stat (highest goes first)
- Ties broken by RNG
- Turn order recalculated each round

**Action Types:**
- **Basic Attack:** Always available
- **Use Skill:** If energy available and not on cooldown
- **Use Ultimate:** If energy available
- **Defend:** Increase DEF/RES by 50% this turn, gain 1 energy
- **Switch Character:** Swap with bench (once per round per character)
- **Use Item:** Consumables (limited per battle)

**Energy System:**
- Start battle with 1 energy per character
- Gain energy by: acting (1), being hit (1), using basic attack (+1)
- Max 4 energy per character

### 6.2 Damage Calculation

```
Base Damage = ATK * Skill Multiplier

Physical Damage = Base Damage * (1 - DEF / (DEF + 200 + 10 * Attacker_Level))
Mystical Damage = Base Damage * (1 - RES / (RES + 200 + 10 * Attacker_Level))

Critical Damage = Damage * (1 + CDMG)

Final Damage = Damage * (1 + Buffs - Debuffs) * Type_Effectiveness
```

**Type Effectiveness (Pathway Advantage):**
- Some pathways counter others (1.3x damage)
- Example: Sun → Death, Darkness → Tyrant, Error → Apprentice

### 6.3 Status Effects

#### Buffs
- **ATK Up:** +X% ATK (stackable)
- **DEF Up:** +X% DEF
- **SPD Up:** +X SPD
- **Shield:** Absorbs X damage before HP loss
- **Regeneration:** Heal X HP per turn
- **Immunity:** Cannot receive debuffs
- **Stealth:** Cannot be targeted by single-target attacks

#### Debuffs
- **ATK Down:** -X% ATK
- **DEF Down:** -X% DEF (armor break)
- **SPD Down:** -X SPD (slow)
- **Stun:** Cannot act this turn
- **Freeze:** Cannot act, take +50% damage
- **Burn:** Take X mystical damage per turn
- **Bleed:** Take X physical damage per turn
- **Poison:** Take X% max HP damage per turn
- **Curse:** All healing received reduced by 50%
- **Marked:** Take +X% damage from all sources
- **Taunt:** Forced to target taunting character

**Status Duration:** 1-5 turns unless cleansed
**Stacking:** Some effects stack (damage types), others refresh duration (control effects)

### 6.4 Team Composition
- **Party Size:** 4 active + 2 bench
- **Switching:** Can swap characters once per character per round (costs that character's turn)
- **Death:** If character HP reaches 0, they're KO'd and removed from battle
- **Synergy Bonuses:** Having multiple characters from same pathway or complementary roles grants passive bonuses

**Synergy Examples:**
- **2 Fool Pathway:** +10% effect resistance for all allies
