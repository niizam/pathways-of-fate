## 3. Acting Method

The **Acting Method** is a unique progression mechanic where characters gain power by role-playing their pathway's archetype.

### 3.1 Acting Progress System

**How It Works:**
- Each character has Acting Progress: 0-100%
- Progress is gained by performing actions that align with the character's sequence role
- Completing "Acting Principles" grants large progress chunks
- Required to reach 100% before sequence advancement

### 3.2 Gaining Acting Progress

#### Small Gains (Combat Actions)
- Use signature abilities: +0.1-0.5% per use
- Defeat enemies with pathway-appropriate methods: +0.5%
- Trigger sequence-specific mechanics: +1%

**Example (Klein - Faceless Seq 6):**
- Use "Flame Jump" (teleport): +0.3%
- Successfully dodge with "Fool's Veil": +0.5%
- Summon with "Historical Void Projection": +1%

#### Medium Gains (Missions)
- Complete acting principle missions: +5-10%
- Win battles using sequence-appropriate strategy: +2%
- Reach milestones (100 dodges, 50 teleports): +3-5%

#### Large Gains (Major Achievements)
- Complete character story quest: +20%
- Finish dedicated acting questline: +30%
- Achieve sequence-specific title: +15%

### 3.3 Acting Principles (Character-Specific Missions)

Each character has 5-10 unique acting principles that reflect their sequence identity:

   - Reward: +15% Acting Progress
   - Unlock: Always available

**Derrick Berg (Sequence 7 - Solar High Priest) Examples:**

1. **Purifier of Darkness**
   - "Purify 100 debuffs from allies"
   - Reward: +10% Acting Progress

2. **Light's Judgment**

### 3.4 Acting Progress Benefits

Acting Progress provides passive bonuses even before reaching 100%:

| Acting % | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| 10% | +1% to all stats |
| 20% | +2% to all stats |
| 30% | +3% to all stats |
| 40% | +4% to all stats |
| 50% | +5% to all stats + Unlock Passive Trait 1 |
| 60% | +6% to all stats |
| 70% | +7% to all stats |
| 80% | +8% to all stats |
| 90% | +9% to all stats |
| 100% | +10% to all stats + Unlock Passive Trait 2 + Enable Sequence Advancement |

**Example Passive Traits (Klein Seq 6 at 50% & 100%):**
- **50% Trait**: "Jester's Luck" - +10% dodge chance
- **100% Trait**: "Faceless Mastery" - Can copy 1 enemy buff per battle

### 3.5 Acting Tips & Strategy

**Efficient Acting Progress:**
1. Complete acting principles as soon as unlocked (highest returns)
2. Use character in their preferred role (tanks should tank, healers should heal)
3. Complete character story quests (huge progress chunks)
4. Auto-battle doesn't count for most acting gains (manual play required)
5. Don't rush sequence advancement - maximize acting benefits first

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Advancing sequence too early (wasted acting progress)
- Using character in wrong role (slow acting gains)
- Ignoring acting principles (missing 80% of progress potential)
- Forgetting that acting resets on sequence advancement (new acting for new sequence)

### 3.6 Acting Progress After Sequence Advancement

**Important:** Acting Progress resets to 0% after sequence advancement!

**Post-Advancement Process:**
1. Character advances sequence (e.g., Seq 6 → Seq 5)
2. Acting Progress resets: 100% → 0%
3. New acting principles unlock for new sequence
4. Must complete new acting to advance again

**Example (Klein Seq 6 → Seq 5):**
- Before: Faceless (Seq 6, 100% acting)
- After: Marionettist (Seq 5, 0% acting)
- New Principles: "Master of Puppets", "Spirit Thread Control", etc.
