## 🔧 Technical Infrastructure

### Database & Backend (✅ Complete)

**JSON Database System** *(Completed October 2025)*

## 🚀 Deployment & Hosting

### Current State (✅ Simplified)

- ❌ Redis removed (using in-memory cache)

**Setup Simplification:**
```bash
git clone [repo]
cd pathways-of-fate
npm run install:all
npm run dev
# Server: http://localhost:5000
# Client: http://localhost:5173
```

**Self-Hosting Requirements (Updated):**
- ✅ Node.js 18+
- ❌ PostgreSQL (no longer required)

- ✅ 5GB storage (reduced, JSON files are smaller)

**Benefits:**
- Much simpler deployment
- Easier for contributors to set up
- Reduced infrastructure complexity
- Portable data (just copy JSON files)

**Trade-offs:**
- JSON storage not suitable for very large deployments
- In-memory cache lost on restart (battles expire)
- Manual backup recommended (copy data folder)
